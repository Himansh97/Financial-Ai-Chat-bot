    "Chatbot Prototype Documentation\n",
    "This document provides a brief overview of the simple financial analysis chatbot prototype developed.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the Chatbot Works\n",
    "This chatbot prototype is implemented using a basic Python script. Its core functionality relies on if-else statements to recognize specific keywords or phrases within the user's input. When a user types a query, the chatbot converts it to lowercase and removes leading/trailing whitespace for standardization. It then checks the processed query against a series of predefined conditions. If a match is found for a specific financial query, the chatbot retrieves and returns a pre-formatted response using the hardcoded summary data (average revenue growth, total financials, highest growth years, and average total assets) derived from the 10k.csv analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predefined Queries It Can Respond To\n",
    "The chatbot is designed to respond to the following exact predefined queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Revenue Growth:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What is the average revenue growth for Apple?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What is the average revenue growth for Microsoft?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What is the average revenue growth for Tesla?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Total Revenue and Net Income (for Apple):\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What are the total revenue and net income for Apple?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Apple's total financials\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Highest Revenue Growth Year:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Which company had the highest revenue growth year and when for Apple?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Which company had the highest revenue growth year and when for Microsoft?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Which company had the highest revenue growth year and when for Tesla?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Peak revenue growth for Apple/Microsoft/Tesla\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Average Total Assets:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What are the average total assets for Apple?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What are the average total assets for Microsoft?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What are the average total assets for Tesla?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations\n",
    "Due to its simplified design as a prototype, this chatbot has several limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limited Natural Language Understanding: It relies heavily on exact keyword matching and if-else logic. It cannot understand synonyms, misspellings, or complex sentence structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Conversational Memory: The chatbot does not remember previous interactions within the same conversation. Each query is treated as a new, independent request.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixed Data: The financial data it uses is hardcoded within the script. It cannot dynamically query a live database or perform new calculations beyond what's pre-summarized.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Advanced Analytics: It cannot perform complex calculations on the fly, answer open-ended analytical questions, or generate new insights. It only provides information for its predefined queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "No Error Handling for Data Gaps: If a requested company's data is not explicitly hardcoded for a specific query type, it will simply ask the user to specify a company rather than attempting to fetch or calculate it.\n",
    "\"\"\""
