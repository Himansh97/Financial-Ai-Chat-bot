# Financial-Ai-Chat-bot
# 💬 AI-Powered Financial Chatbot 🤖📊

Welcome to my **Financial Chatbot**—a Generative AI-powered assistant that extracts and explains complex financial data from SEC filings (10-Ks & 10-Qs) in plain English. Built as part of BCG's GenAI Virtual Experience on Forage, this project showcases the potential of LLMs + rule-based logic in financial advisory and consulting domains.

## 🔍 Project Overview

In this simulation, I acted as a consultant on BCG's GenAI team and developed a prototype chatbot that:

✅ Parses and interprets 10-K and 10-Q financial reports  
✅ Uses **Python** and **pandas** for data extraction and cleaning  
✅ Applies **rule-based logic** to surface red flags, growth signals, and insights  
✅ Delivers human-readable answers to financial queries like “What are the company’s main risk factors?” or “Has revenue increased YoY?”

## 📸 Demo Preview

> **User**: "What is the company’s revenue trend over the last 3 quarters?"  
> **Chatbot**: “The company's revenue has shown consistent growth, increasing from $2.3B in Q1 to $2.9B in Q3, indicating a positive trajectory.”

> **User**: "Are there any debt-related concerns?"  
> **Chatbot**: “Yes, the long-term debt increased by 18% YoY, while interest coverage ratio declined, suggesting higher financial risk.”
